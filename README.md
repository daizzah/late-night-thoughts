### 💭 Project Overview

Late Night Thoughts is a public, zero-login platform designed for brief, genuine reflection. It provides an immediate, anonymous outlet for thoughts without the pressure of a personal profile or commitment.

### ⏰ Access and Limits

The application enforces specific constraints to maintain a focused and intentional environment:

- **Quiet Hours:** Posting is only enabled between **10:00 PM and 5:00 AM** (based on your local time). Outside of this window, the submission form is disabled.
- **Post Limit:** Users are restricted to a maximum of **three anonymous submissions** per night.
- **Length Limit:** Each post must be under **800 characters**.

All submitted thoughts are shared anonymously and displayed in a live feed.
